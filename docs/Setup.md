# Setup Guide
The app is built with Gradle and can be compiled on macOS, Windows, and Linux.  Development is typically done with the latest stable release of Android Studio.

Tip: On macOS and Linux, Gradle is invoked with `./gradlew`.  On Windows, Gradle is invoked with `gradlew`.  Throughout the documentation, the macOS and Linux syntax is used by default.

Tip: You do NOT need to install Gradle yourself.  Running it from the command line or building the application within Android Studio will download the necessary dependencies automatically.

## Step by Step
To get set up for development, there are several steps that you need to go through.  Going through these steps in order is important, as each step in the progression builds on the prior steps.

Start by making sure the command line with Gradle works first, because **all the Android Studio run configurations use Gradle internally.**  The run configurations are not magicâ€”they map directly to command line invocations with different arguments.

1. Install Java
    1. Java 16 is currently recommended. Java 11 is the minimum requirement for Android Studio.
    1. To simplify installation, use [Oracle's JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html) installer that will place the Java installation in the right place
1. Install Android Studio and the Android SDK
    1. Download the [Android Studio Bumblebee Canary](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview) (we're using the Canary version, due to its improved integration with Jetpack Compose)
    1. TODO: Fill in step-by-step instructions for setting up a new environment and installing the Android SDK from within Android Studio
1. Check out the code.  _Use the command line (instead of Android Studio) to check out the code. This will ensure that your command line environment is set up correctly and avoids a few pitfalls with trying to use Android Studio directly.  Android Studio's built-in git client is not as robust as standalone clients_
1. Compile from the command line
    1. Navigate to the repo checkout in a terminal
    1. Compile the application with the gradle command `./gradlew assemble`
1. Compile from Android Studio
    1. Open Android Studio
    1. From within Android Studio, choose to open an existing project and navigate to the checked out repo
    1. After Android Studio finishes syncing with Gradle, look for the green "play" run button in the toolbar.  To the left of it, choose the "App" run configuration under the dropdown menu.  Then hit the run button

## Troubleshooting
1. Try running from the command line instead of Android Studio, to rule out Android Studio issues.  If it works from the command line, try this step to reset Android Studio
   1. Quit Android Studio
   2. Deleting the invisible `.idea` in the root directory of the project
   3. Relaunch Android Studio
2. Clean the individual Gradle project by running `./gradlew clean` which will purge local build outputs.
3. Run Gradle with the argument `--rerun-tasks` which will effectively disable the build cache by re-running tasks and repopulating the cache.  E.g. `./gradlew assemble --rerun-tasks`
4. Reboot your computer, which will ensure that Gradle and Kotlin daemons are completely killed and relaunched
5. Delete the global Gradle cache under `~/.gradle/caches`
6. If adding a new dependency or updating a dependency, a warning that a dependency cannot be found may indicate the Maven repository restrictions need adjusting

## Gradle Tasks
A variety of Gradle tasks are set up within the project, and these tasks are also accessible in Android Studio as run configurations.
 * `assemble` - Compiles the application but does not deploy it
 * `assembleAndroidTest` - Compiles the application and tests, but does not deploy the application or run the tests
 * `detektAll` - Performs static analysis with Detekt
 * `ktlint` - Performs code formatting checks with ktlint
 * `lint` - Performs static analysis with Android lint
 * `dependencyUpdates` - Checks for available dependency updates

## Gradle Properties
A variety of Gradle properties can be used to configure the build.

### Debug Signing
By default, the application is signed by the developers automatically generated debug signing key.  In a team of developers, it may be advantageous to share a debug key so that debug builds can access key-restricted services such as Firebase or Google Maps.  For such a setup, the path to a shared debug signing key can be set with the property `ZCASH_DEBUG_KEYSTORE_PATH`.

### Release Signing
To enable release signing, a release keystore needs to be provided during the build.  This can be injected securely by setting the following Gradle properties.
* ZCASH_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PATH
* ZCASH_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
* ZCASH_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
* ZCASH_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS_PASSWORD

On a developer machine, these might be set under the user's global properties (e.g. `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` on macOS and Linux).  On a continuous integration machine, these can also be set using environment variables with the prefix `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_` (e.g. `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_ZCASH_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PATH`).  DO NOT set these in the gradle.properties inside the Git repository, as this will leak your keystore password.
