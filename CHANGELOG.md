### Changed
- Zcash SDK version 2.2.3-SNAPSHOT has been adopted

### Fixed
- The Zec to USD currency conversion logic on the Send screen, which caused issues on lower Android SDK versions 
 together with non-English device localizations, has been fixed. 

## [1.1.6 (712)] - 2024-09-04

### Added
- Zcash SDK 2.2.2 has been adopted. It brings several new important features:
- Currency exchange rates (currently just USD/ZEC) are now made available via the SDK.
  The exchange rate computed as the median of values provided by at least three separate
  cryptocurrency exchanges, and is fetched over Tor connections in order to avoid leaking
  the wallet's IP address to the exchanges.
- Sending to ZIP 320 (TEX) addresses is now supported. When sending to a ZIP 320 address,
  the wallet will first automatically de-shield the required funds to a fresh ephemeral
  transparent address, and then will make a second fully-transparent transaction sending
  the funds to the eventual recipient that is not linkable via on-chain information to any
  other transaction in the  user's wallet.
- As part of adding ZIP 320 support, the SDK now also provides full support for recovering
  transparent transaction history. Prior to this release, only transactions belonging to the
  wallet that contained either some shielded component OR a member of the current
  transparent UTXO set were included in transaction history.
- Thus, the balances widget now optionally displays the USD value as well
- A new option to enter the USD amount in the Send screen has been added

## [1.1.5 (706)] - 2024-08-09

  UTXOs fetching logic

## [1.1.4 (700)] - 2024-07-23

### Added
- A new What's New screen has been added, accessible from the About screen. It contains the release notes parsed 
  from the new [docs/whatsNew/WHATS_NEW_EN.md] file
- These release notes and release priority are both propagated to every new Google Play release using CI logic
- Copying sensitive information like addresses, transaction IDs, or wallet secrets into the device clipboard is now 
  masked out from the system visual confirmation, but it's still copied as expected. `ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE`
flag is used on Android SDK level 33 and higher, masking out the `Toast` text on levels below it.
- `androidx.fragment:fragment-compose` dependency has been added

### Changed
- The About screen has been redesigned to align with the new design guidelines
- `StyledBalance` text styles have been refactored from `Pair` into `BalanceTextStyle`

  on while restoring option

- The Zcash SDK dependency has been switched from `2.1.2-SNAPSHOT` to `2.1.2`

### Fixed
- Support Screen now shows the Send button above keyboard instead of overlaying it. This was achieved by setting 
  `adjustResize` to `MainActivity` and adding `imePadding` to top level composable
- QR code scanning speed and reliability have been improved to address the latest reported scan issue. The obtained 
  image cropping and image reader hints have been changed as part of these improvements.
- The handling of Android configuration changes has been improved. 
  `android:configChanges="orientation|locale|layoutDirection|screenLayout|uiMode|colorMode|keyboard|screenSize"`
  option has been added to the app's `AndroidManifest.xml`, leaving the configuration changes handling entirely to 
  the Jetpack Compose layer.
