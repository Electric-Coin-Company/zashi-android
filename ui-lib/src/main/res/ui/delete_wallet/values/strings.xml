        Make sure you have both your secret recovery phrase and wallet birthday height saved before you
        proceed.\n\nResetting the Zashi app will delete the app database and cached app data, and disconnect all
        connected hardware wallets.\n\nOnce you Reset Zashi, the only way to access your funds is through a wallet
        restore process that requires your Zashi Recovery Phrase and Wallet Birthday Height.
