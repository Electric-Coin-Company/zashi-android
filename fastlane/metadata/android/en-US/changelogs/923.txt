Added:
- Transparent Funds Rescue - Zashi can now help you recover funds from fully transparent wallets like Ledger. We recommend importing your transparent hardware wallet recovery phrase into a Keystone hardware wallet and then pairing it with Zashi using the Keystone integration.

Fixed:
- We fixed a long-standing note commitment tree issue that affected a small number of users. Zashi is now able to allow stuck funds to be spent.
