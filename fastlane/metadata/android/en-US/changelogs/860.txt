Changed:
- We refactored the QR code logic and changed the colors of the QR code to improve scanning by the Keystone device.
- We improved the block synchronization progress logic.
- We updated the Keystone SDK to version 0.7.10 which includes QR code scanning improvement.

Fixed:
- We fixed the logic for the Disconnected popup for cases when the app is backgrounded.
- We also resolved an issue with the app's navigation stack not getting cleared up after clicking on the View Transactions button.
