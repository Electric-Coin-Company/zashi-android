Zashiâ€™s built-in Tor client can now be used to:
- Submit ZEC transactions
- Fetch transaction data
- Connect to third-party APIs (e.g. NEAR)
- Fetch ZEC-USD exchange rates
- If Tor is available in your region, we strongly recommend enabling it.
- Note: Currency Conversion now only works with Tor enabled.

Other Updates:
- We added address explainers.
- We improved app startup startup time.
- We fixed bugs in ZIP 321 scanning, Send again flow, and other UI/UX issues.
