Changed:
- Zashi no longer includes transparent receivers in Unified Addresses.
- The Receive screen now displays a rotating, shielded-only UA which gets freshly generated each time you open the Receive screen.
- All transactions sent to your different rotating Shielded Addresses will remain part of one wallet balance under the same seed phrase.
- Wallets and exchanges that donâ€™t support sending funds to shielded receivers will require transparent address.
