# Forking

If you plan to fork the project to create a new app of your own, please make
the following changes.  (If you're making a GitHub fork to contribute back to
the project, these steps are not necessary.)

1. Change the app name under [gradle.properties](gradle.properties)
    1. See `ZCASH_RELEASE_APP_NAME`
1. Change the package name under [app/build.gradle.kts](app/build.gradle.kts)
    1. See `ZCASH_RELEASE_PACKAGE_NAME`
1. Change the support email address under [strings.xml](ui-lib/src/main/res/ui/non_translatable/values/strings.xml)
    1. See `support_email_address`
1. Remove any copyrighted ZCash or Electric Coin Company icons, logos, or assets
    1. ui-lib/src/main/res/common/ - All of the the ic_launcher assets
1. Optional
    1. Configure secrets and variables for [Continuous Integration](docs/CI.md)
    1. Configure Firebase API keys and place them under `app/src/debug/google-services.json` and `app/src/release/google-services.json`

# Known Issues

1. During builds, a warning will be printed that says "Unable to detect AGP
   versions for included builds. All projects in the build should use the same
   AGP version."  This can be safely ignored.  The version under
   build-conventions is the same as the version used elsewhere in the
   application.
1. When the code coverage Gradle property
   `IS_ANDROID_INSTRUMENTATION_TEST_COVERAGE_ENABLED` is enabled, the debug app
   APK cannot be run.  The coverage flag should therefore only be set when
   running automated tests.
1. Test coverage for Compose code will be low, due to [known limitations](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco/issues/1208) in the interaction between Compose and Jacoco.
1. Adding the `espresso-contrib` dependency will cause builds to fail, due to conflicting classes.  This is a [known issue](https://github.com/Electric-Coin-Company/zcash-android-wallet-sdk/issues/306) with the Zcash Android SDK.
1. Android Studio will warn about the Gradle checksum.  This is a [known issue](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/9361) and can be safely ignored.
1. During app first launch, the following exception starting with `AndroidKeysetManager: keyset not found, will generate a new one` is printed twice.  This exception is not an error, and the code is not being invoked twice.
1. While syncing Gradle files, build error with `org.jetbrains:markdown` dependency locking might occur. It is a 
   filed [known issue](https://github.com/Electric-Coin-Company/zashi-android/issues/1526) that does not block building 
   the project.
